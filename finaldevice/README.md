This is the folder that contains the arduino code for the sleep apnea device in `finaldevice.ino`.  It is written and done in the Arduino IDE.

The code will read in ECG signals, convert them to heart rate, feed them through a Neural Network and output a result of yes (sleep apnea event) or no (no sleep apnea event) back to the device for the user to see.
