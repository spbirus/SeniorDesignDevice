# SeniorDesignDevice
Code for senior design device for Sam, Dan, and Jon.  Sleep apnea detection.

## The final prototype
The `finaldevice` folder contains the arduino code for the sleep apnea detection device.
The `Jon_Algorithm` folder contains the code that trained our Neural Network off the device and the heart rate extraction algorithm.

The remaining folders were all trials for different bluetooth modules or arduino code.  They are unnessesary but provide some proof of design modification.
